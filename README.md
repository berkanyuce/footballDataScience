# footballDataScience
I'll add football analyze examples.

Free datas are used in this repository. My resources are Statsbomb, Wyscout, etc. And also I create my own datasets from watching football games. I will share my datasets in associated folder. If there is no data in folder, this means the data is took from free resources. I attach the resource I use to my code.
